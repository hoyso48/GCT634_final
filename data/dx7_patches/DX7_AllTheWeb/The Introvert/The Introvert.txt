These new banks contain fresh patterns generated by Deep DX, a custom AI system trained on thousands of DX7 patches, based on FM algorithm and sound category.
A few sounds have been manually tweaked to ensure full playability and optimal sound levels.
It contains four folders:

- "Fun With Algos": 11 banks of 32 patches where each bank is created for a specific algorithm
- "FM Unmasked": 3 banks of various sounds aimed to explore the domain of FM synthesis
- "DX7 AI Pianos": 4 banks of FM pianos from classic DX Rhodes to more soteric variants
- "DX7 AI Pads": 2 banks of evolving pad sounds
